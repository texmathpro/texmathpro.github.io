  <h2>Why These Exams Exist</h2>
  <p>
    Most online math exams are visually noisy, mathematically loose,
    and impossible to audit. These exams are the opposite.
  </p>
  <p>
    Every assessment is written directly in LaTeX, built from explicit
    learning objectives, and maintained as source code rather than
    disposable documents.
